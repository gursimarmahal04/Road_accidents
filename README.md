# üìä The Analysis  

Each query in this project was designed to investigate key aspects of **road accident patterns**. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:  


### 1. Genral Accident Analysis.
To understand overall accident trends, I analyzed accident counts across different factors such as **location, time, and month**. This query highlights:  


```SQL
--Total number of accidents

SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_accidents
FROM road_accidents_stagging;
```

| Metric           | Value     |
|------------------|-----------|
| Total Accidents  | 1,94,061  |

The dataset indicates a total of **194,061** recorded accidents between the years **2021 and 2022**.

---
```sql
-- Monthly trend 

SELECT month ,
    COUNT(*) AS Total_accidents
FROM road_accidents_stagging
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
| Month | Total Accidents |

3. The **afternoon** (12:00 - 16:00) and **evening** (18:00 - 20:00) hours consistently show higher accident numbers, reflecting the times when traffic is heavier, potentially coupled with lower visibility or driving fatigue.


### 2. Accident Severity Analysis
To understand the severity of road accidents, I analyzed how different factors influence accident outcomes. This query provides insights into:  
#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **How accidents are distributed by severity** (Fatal, Serious, Slight).  
```sql
--Count of accidents by severity level

SELECT accident_severity, COUNT(*)
FROM road_accidents_stagging
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
| Accident Severity | Count    |
|------------------|---------|
| Slight          | 166,196 |
| Serious         | 25,408  |
| Fatal          | 2,457   |

#### üîç Key Insights:  
- **üöó Majority of accidents (85.7%) are classified as "Slight"**, meaning most incidents result in minor injuries or damage.  
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Serious accidents make up 13.1%**, indicating a significant portion of accidents cause major injuries.  
- **üíÄ Fatal accidents account for only 1.2%**, but their impact is severe, highlighting the need for improved road safety measures.  
- **üìâ Potential Actions:** Focus on reducing serious and fatal accidents through better road designs, traffic control, and driver awareness programs.  



#### üåßÔ∏è **The impact of weather conditions on severity levels** (e.g., rain vs. clear weather).  
```sql

### 3. Location Based Analysis

This analysis focuses on identifying **high-risk accident zones** using **latitude and longitude data**. The goal is to pinpoint locations with the highest accident counts and understand regional patterns.

```sql
--Districts with the highest number of accident counts.

WITH a1 AS (
    SELECT local_authority_district,
           COUNT(*) AS accident_count
    FROM road_accidents_stagging
    GROUP BY local_authority_district
),
total_accidents AS (
    SELECT SUM(accident_count) AS total 
    FROM a1
)
SELECT 
    a1.local_authority_district, 
    a1.accident_count, 
    ROUND(a1.accident_count * 100.0 / total_accidents.total, 2) AS Percentage
FROM a1, total_accidents
ORDER BY a1.accident_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

| Local Authority District | Accident Count | Percentage (%) |
|--------------------------|---------------|---------------|
